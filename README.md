Tour.IST Augmented Reality app
==============================

Built when AR was still cool and Android HoneyComb was fresh out of the oven, this is my very first Android application.

Tested against only Android 2.2, but some newer (at the time) APIs were used. With no access to a HoneyComb device to test it against back then, I can't guarantee it works flawlessly on newer devices.

Built within 3 weeks of 2011 and never touched again, this project was abandoned with incomplete features and high hopes. The road ahead is rough, travel at your own peril.
